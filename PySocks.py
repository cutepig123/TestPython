"""SOCKS 4 proxy server class.

Copyright (C) 2001  Xavier Lagraula
See COPYRIGHT.txt and GPL.txt for copyrights information.

Build upon the TCPServer class of the SocketServer module, the Socks4Proxy
class is an implementation of the SOCKS protocol, version 4.

This server uses one thread per connection request.

Features:
- CONNECT and BIND requests
- IDENT protocol check when a userid is provided in the request

Missing features
- A configuration file
- Command line parameters
- Support for other server architectures (forking, synchronous with select...)
- Control of the timeout limit when handling CONNECT requests
- Support for multi-homed servers (need configuration options)
- A rules system for validating incoming requests
- Configurable logging (waiting for the release of a os-independent logging
  facility)
- Support for the SOCKS 4a request format extension
- Support for forwarding of the request to another SOCKS server

Features under construction:
- Default configuration (only for dos, nt, ce and posix for now)

Known bugs:
- Some CONNECT request closed by the client are not detected and finish in an
  infinite loop of select always returning the "request" socket as ready to
  read even if there is nothing more to read on it. This situation is now
  detected and lead to a Closed_Connection exception.

Implementation choices:
- Protocol errors are handled by exceptions
- The function that creates a socket is responsible for its closing -> never
  close a socket passed in as a parameter, and always use a try/finally block
  after creating a socket to ensure correct closing of sockets.
